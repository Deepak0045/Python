# Python String Manipulation and Formatting

This project demonstrates essential techniques for working with strings in Python, including creation, manipulation, and formatting. It covers a range of methods and practices for handling text data, an important part of many Python applications.

## Topics Covered

1. **Creating and Displaying Strings**

2. **String Concatenation**

3. **Escape Sequences**

4. **String Formatting**
   - Old Style Formatting
   - New Style Formatting
   - f-Strings

5. **String Indexing and Slicing**

6. **String Methods**
   - **capitalize()**: Capitalizes the first character of the string
   - **count()**: Counts occurrences of a substring
   - **endswith()**: Checks if the string ends with a specific suffix
   - **find()** and **rfind()**: Finds the first or last occurrence of a substring
   - **isalnum()**: Checks if all characters are alphanumeric
   - **isalpha()**: Checks if all characters are alphabetic
   - **isdecimal()**: Checks if all characters are decimal digits
   - **isdigit()**: Checks if all characters are numeric
   - **islower()**: Checks if all alphabetic characters are lowercase
   - **isupper()**: Checks if all alphabetic characters are uppercase
   - **join()**: Concatenates a list of strings with a specified separator
   - **strip()**: Removes specified characters from the start and end of the string
   - **replace()**: Replaces a specified substring with another string
   - **split()**: Splits the string into a list based on a specified separator
