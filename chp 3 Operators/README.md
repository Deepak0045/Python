# Python Operators and Their Usage

This project demonstrates essential techniques for using operators in Python. Operators are fundamental for performing operations on data such as mathematical calculations, comparisons, and logical evaluations. This guide covers a variety of operators and how to use them in Python programs.

## Topics Covered

1. **Boolean Operators**

2. **Assignment Operators**

3. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - **+**: Addition
   - **-**: Subtraction
   - **\***: Multiplication
   - **/**: Division
   - **//**: Floor division
   - **%**: Modulus (remainder of division)
   - **\*\***: Exponentiation

4. **Comparison Operators**
   - **>**: Greater than
   - **>=**: Greater than or equal to
   - **<**: Less than
   - **<=**: Less than or equal to
   - **==**: Equal to
   - **!=**: Not equal to
   - **is**: Identity comparison
   - **in**: Membership check

5. **Logical Operators**
   - **and**: Combines two conditions, returns `True` only if both conditions are `True`
   - **or**: Combines two conditions, returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`
   - **not**: Negates the condition, returns the opposite of the original value
