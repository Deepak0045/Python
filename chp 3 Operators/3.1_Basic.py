# Boolean
# A boolean data type represents one of the two values: True or False. The use of these data types will be clear once we start 
# using the comparison operator. The first letter T for True and F for False should be capital unlike JavaScript. 

# Example: Boolean Values

print(True)
print(False)

# Assignment Operators in Python
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The most basic assignment operator is =.

# Basic Assignment
# Python
# x = 10  # Assigns the value 10 to the variable x


x = 5

# Increment x by 3
x += 3
print(x)  # Output: 8

# Multiply x by 2
x *= 2
print(x)  # Output: 16

# Divide x by 4
x /= 4
print(x)  # Output: 4.0
print()
print()


# Arithmetic Operators in Python
# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values.
# Python supports the following arithmetic operators: Â  

# List of Arithmetic Operators
# Operator	Description	Example
# +	    Addition	    x + y
# -	    Subtraction	    x - y
# *	    Multiplication	x * y
# /	    Division	    x / y
# //	Floor division (returns the integer quotient)	x // y
# %	    Modulus (returns the remainder)	x % y
# **	Exponentiation	x ** y
